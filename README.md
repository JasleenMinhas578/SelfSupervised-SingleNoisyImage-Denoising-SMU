# 🧠 Single Noisy Image Self-Supervised Denoising Using Paired Downsampling and SMU Activation


### Efficient Image Denoising using Self-Supervised Learning with Downsampling

This project implements an efficient, compact image denoising system based on a self-supervised learning approach with a downsampling technique. It requires **no clean-noisy image pairs or external training datasets** — the model learns to denoise from the **noisy input alone**.

Clean images are only used for comparison and visualization of denoising quality (e.g., computing PSNR), not for training or supervision.

### 📌 Overview

This repository implements a novel **self-supervised image denoising framework** designed for scenarios where clean ground truth images are unavailable. Unlike conventional supervised techniques (like DnCNN or U-Net) or multi-noise-based methods (like Noise2Noise), this approach uses **a single noisy image** and introduces the following key innovations:

- 🔄 **Paired Downsampling Strategy**: A physics-inspired structural downsampling to ensure cross-scale consistency.
- 🧪 **Smooth Mixing Unit (SMU) Activation**: A trainable activation function to better distinguish signal from noise.
- ⚖️ **Hybrid Loss Function**: Combines residual learning with cross-scale consistency constraints for robust denoising.

This method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised models—**without needing any clean-noisy image pairs**.

---

### 📊 Highlights

- **Self-supervised training** using only noisy images.
- Achieves **26.42 dB PSNR** at noise level σ=0.2.
- Outperforms **Noise2Void (+3.2 dB)** and **Deep Image Prior (+1.8 dB)**.
- Matches the performance of **supervised DnCNN trained on 400 image pairs**.
- Handles **synthetic and real-world noise (σ = 0.1 to 0.5)**.

## 🧠 Network Architecture

- **Input:** Noisy RGB image
- **Layers:**
  - Two `3x3` convolutional layers with SMU activation
  - One `1x1` convolutional layer for final noise prediction
- **Activation Function:** Smooth Mixing Unit (SMU), a learnable function designed for adaptive non-linearity

## 🏗️ Methodology

Our self-supervised denoising framework is built around three core innovations that allow learning directly from a **single noisy image** — no clean reference required. Here's a breakdown of each component:

---

### 1. 🔄 Paired Downsampling Strategy

We simulate the presence of multiple views by applying **paired downsampling** to the input image at different scales. This technique introduces cross-scale consistency constraints:

- Mimics different observations of the same image.
- Enforces structural coherence without extra data.
- Helps the network focus on preserving signal across resolutions.

💡 *Think of it like listening to the same melody at different volumes — the tune remains the same, but the distortions (noise) change, which helps us better isolate the core rhythm (signal).*

---

### 2. 🧪 Smooth Mixing Unit (SMU) Activation Function

Standard activation functions (like ReLU or Swish) are not adaptive to varying noise intensities. SMU changes that:

- **Learnable activation function** designed to filter out noise dynamically.
- Allows the network to distinguish between subtle signals and random noise.
- Enhances convergence and generalization, especially with small datasets.

🔬 *SMU acts like a smart gatekeeper — it lets useful signal flow freely but softens the influence of noise through adaptive smoothing.*

---

### 3. ⚖️ Hybrid Loss Function

Our loss formulation combines two objectives that guide the network:

#### 📉 a. Residual Prediction Loss  
- Focuses on predicting the residual (difference) between the noisy input and the clean output.

#### 🔁 b. Cross-Scale Consistency Loss  
- Ensures that the denoised outputs at different downsampling levels remain consistent.
- Encourages the network to produce reliable outputs across multiple views of the same image.

🧠 *It's like correcting your work by comparing your notes in two different notebooks — if they agree, you're probably right.*

Together, these components form a **lightweight yet powerful** self-supervised denoising system that adapts to noise, preserves signal, and learns without supervision.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To validate the performance of our self-supervised denoising model, we used standard quantitative metrics commonly used in image restoration:

### ✅ Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Measures the ratio between the maximum possible signal and the noise affecting its fidelity.
- **Higher PSNR = Better denoising quality**.
- Our method achieved **26.42 dB** at σ = 0.2.

### ✅ Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
- Evaluates the visual similarity between denoised and reference images in terms of luminance, contrast, and structure.
- **SSIM closer to 1 indicates better perceptual quality**.

### 📈 Comparative Performance
| Method           | PSNR (σ = 0.2) | SSIM |
|------------------|----------------|------|
| Noise2Void       | 23.2 dB        | 0.74 |
| Deep Image Prior | 24.6 dB        | 0.78 |
| **Ours (SMU-Net)**   | **26.42 dB**      | **0.83** |
| DnCNN (Supervised)   | 26.8 dB        | 0.84 |

📌 *Note: Our approach performs competitively with fully supervised models—without ever seeing a clean image!*
