# SelfSupervised-SingleNoisyImage-Denoising-SMU
A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to estimate and subtract noise from a given image using only the noisy input itself. The network learns via a self-supervised objective that encourages consistent noise estimation across different downsampled versions of the same noisy image.
